Welcome to my blog about the Internet of Things. 

Today I have created this blog by forking the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub. I'm aslo following the guide in [this Smashing Magazine article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/).

I have created an account at Cloudflare and registered the domain [doiotyourself.com](https://doiotyourself.com).

Now to check if my ssh key is working with GitHub. It works!

Next I'll migrate jekyll from [GitHub pages](https://doiotyourself.github.io) to [Cloudflare Pages](https://doiotyourself.pages.dev). I'll follow [this guide at Cloudflare Docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/migrations/migrating-jekyll-from-github-pages/). Done!

Final step for tonight is to and setup the DNS records for my new domain.

Thanks for visiting [doiotyourself.com](https://doiotyourself.com).

See you soon.
