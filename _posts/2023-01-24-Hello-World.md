Welcome to my blog about the Internet of Things. 

Today I have created this blog by forking the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub. I'm aslo following the guide in [this article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/).

I have created an account at Cloudflare and registered the domain [doiotyourself.com](https://doiotyourself.com).
